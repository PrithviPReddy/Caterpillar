"""PROTOTYPE safety rules on SIMULATED telemetry, driven by a versioned policy file.

These are illustrative demo rules. They are not validated machine safety logic and must not be used to protect
people on a real machine. Thresholds come from the policy file and are labelled `demo_assumption`.

Rules read observations only (engine, belt, operating state), never scenario names or expected-output labels.
Durations use the observation clock (`observed_at` of the samples); wall-clock time is used only for freshness,
token expiry, announcement expiry and provider deadlines.
