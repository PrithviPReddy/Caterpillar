# Backend handoff

Newest increment first. Each entry separates what was observed from what is still unverified.

## D1: detections from the simulator's detection layer, and `seat_occupied`

- **Recorded:** 2026-09-24. Prepared by the data/simulation stream (Prithvi) as a proposal for the backend owner. It was built on a local copy of this service (the `cater` repository, `cocoon/`), not on the `backend` branch. No commit was made.
- **Why:** the simulator's detection layer (rules + ML on simulated telemetry) raises about 40 kinds of alerts: proximity, stability, power line, ML machine health, fuel shortfall, weather, fatigue and more. Before D1, only the three policy rules could reach the operator.

### What changed

- **`POST /v1/sessions/{session_id}/detections`** (trusted service only; operator and supervisor tokens get 403):
  - Each detection is one lifecycle step of an episode, keyed by `episode_key` (`rule_id = detector:<key>`).
  - `open` announces the episode: `high` for warning, `critical` for critical.
  - `escalated` to a higher severity ends the episode silently and opens and announces a critical one.
  - `resolved` clears it, with a `Cleared: …` announcement for safety episodes.
  - `update` and `info` are recorded only.
  - `one_shot` notices are announced and closed at once.
  - A critical safety detection gets an automatic draft.
  - The episode evidence is saved once: the detection plus the machine state of that moment. "Why?" reads it.
  - Idempotent on `(session_id, detection_id)`; a different payload is 409.
  - Shares the telemetry lock. The session needs a telemetry sample first, otherwise 422 `machine_state_unavailable`.
- **Optional `seat_occupied` reading.** `false` means an empty seat: the seatbelt and idle-unbelted rules do not apply, but prolonged idle still does. Omitted means unknown, and behaviour is unchanged.
- **"Why?" clarification fix.** It named candidates through a fixed dict, which would raise KeyError for detector alert types. It now falls back to the alert message.
- **Schema v8** (`detector_alerts`), `docs/MIGRATIONS.md`.
- **Additive response fields:**
  - `Alert.source`, `Alert.category`, `Alert.intelligence_level`
  - `AlertEvidence.detection`
  - `alert_type` widened from three values to an open lower-snake string, which clients must treat as opaque
  - new error code `machine_state_unavailable`

### Contracts

- `contracts/openapi.yaml` and `contracts/proposed/` were regenerated with the two export scripts.
- The route is registered in `contract/spec.py` as implemented, stage D1, caller `simulator`.
- `API_CONTRACT.md` covers it in the endpoint table, actor access, the telemetry `seat_occupied` rule, a Detections (D1) section and the capability table.
- New examples `detection.request.json` / `detection.response.json` came from a real run and are registered in `tests/test_contract.py`.

### Checks run and observed results (macOS, Python 3.11, mock mode)

- `python -m pytest -q` in `langgraph-agent/`: **320 passed**. That is 311 before the change plus 7 new tests in `tests/test_detections.py` and 2 new example checks. `tests/test_migrations.py` gained the three new alert columns in `ADDED_COLUMNS`.
- `python scripts/export_openapi.py --check` and `python scripts/export_proposed_contract.py --check`: both up to date.
- `livekit-voice`: `pytest tests/test_contract.py` gives 9 passed against the regenerated spec.
  - The full voice suite gives 136 passed, 17 skipped, 1 failed: `test_config.py::test_remote_brain_is_future_only`.
  - That test fails identically on the unmodified copy, so it is not caused by D1.
- **Real HTTP, end to end:** backend in mock mode, the simulator and `scripts/cocoon_bridge.py` from `cater`.
  - The whole demo day was bridged with no rejected or stale requests: 42 announcements and 6 automatic drafts.
  - Critical priority was used for proximity, stability, power line and lightning.
  - The seatbelt warning at 06:40 came from the policy rule.
  - At lunch, `seat_occupied: false` gave "machine left running unattended" and no false seatbelt warning.
  - Stepping through the day alert by alert, "Why?" answered each alert directly from its saved evidence.

### Remaining risks and next steps

- **Not verified with the voice worker or on a phone:** announcements were read through `GET .../events`, not spoken.
- **Clarification wording:** with several alerts announced since the last turn, "Why?" asks which one the operator means. The clarification wording lists alert messages, which can be long.
- **Detector alerts carry no lesson assignment.** The simulator's training modules (TM-01…TM-11) are not the backend lesson catalogue; they are kept in the evidence.
- **Needs the backend owner's review and agreement** before it is merged: a shared-contract change.

## B4: explanations, idle reasons, shift briefing, training link and the HTTP demo

- **Schema v7:** `idle_reasons`, `shift_briefings`, lesson `version`/`content_text`/`content_status`,
  `training_assignments.source_episode_id`, `alerts.training_assignment_id`.
- **Behaviour:** "Why?" explains the referenced warning from its saved evidence and returns its announcement's
  delivery reports (not acknowledgement); competing warnings get a question. "I'm waiting for a truck" records an idle
  reason and keeps the belt warning. One shift briefing per seeded shift. The belt policy assigns L1 once per
  outstanding assignment, in the alert's transaction; "read my seatbelt lesson" reads the versioned demo text without
  completing it. Safety policy is now `demo-safety-2026-09-24.2` (adds the lesson link).
- **Demo:** `scripts/demo_operator.py` seeds `data/demo_run`, starts a mock backend, runs the nine-step sequence over
  HTTP, writes a transcript and stops. Re-running the same run ID was observed to replay every saved result.
- **Checks:** `tests/test_operator_context.py` (5): evidence-based "why" after readings change, delivery ≠
  acknowledgement, competing warnings; idle reason kept once and belt warning retained; one briefing across sessions
  and restart; one episode-linked L1 assignment across two episodes, operator isolation, reading ≠ completion; legacy
  record never linked. Full suite (310 passed, 1 skipped) and contract drift checks pass. Not observed: audio,
  Android, live-model classification of the B2–B4 intents.

## B3: machine replay, belt/idle episodes and automatic drafts

- **Schema v6:** alert episode columns (policy version, source status, reason, recommended action, evidence,
  correlated episode, linked draft, announced), `machine_state` (latest applied observation with idle streak start)
  and `telemetry_events.provenance_json`. **v5 was revised before release** (never applied outside test databases):
  drafts now live in `incident_drafts` (`DRF-…`, own numbering) and confirming one allocates the real `INC-…` once,
  so drafts never consume report numbers.
- **Rules:** `policies/safety_policy_v1.json` (belt+engine, prolonged idle 300 s, idle+unbelted 60 s; demo
  assumptions). One short transaction per sample applies every rule and writes alert + draft + announcement
  together. Idle time uses observation timestamps; a sample without `operating_state` leaves idle state unknown.
  Late and same-time conflicting samples are recorded and ignored. Telemetry now has its own per-session lock, so it
  never waits for a turn's model call (the graph reads alerts from the DB at turn start).
- **Simulator:** `scripts/simulate_machine.py` (any of the 5 machines; `belt_idle`, `belt_retrigger`,
  `selection_check`, `dataset`).
- **Checks:** `tests/test_safety.py` (5): warning before motion, no spam, one draft, correlation, restart keeps
  episodes and duplicate replay; observation-clock idle timing and unknown state; clear/retrigger/late/conflicting;
  all five assets isolated plus stale freshness; dataset replay (runs only where the ignored dataset exists). Full
  suite and both contract drift checks pass. Not observed: real sensors, live voice playback of these announcements.

## B2: operator workflows, structured incidents and truthful action outcomes

- **Schema v5:** structured incident columns (status draft/confirmed/dismissed, origin, severity + basis, site/zone +
  basis, location text, occurred_at + basis, episode link, version), `approval_requests` (pending supervisor review)
  and `turns.route_json` (the turn's saved classification). Legacy incidents become confirmed operator reports.
- **Routing:** one structured decision per turn adds `branch` and parameters; the graph gains draft review /
  confirm / dismiss / "yes" handling and an honest `capability_unavailable` reply. A bare "yes" acts only when
  exactly one workflow is waiting. A retried turn reuses the saved decision (no second model call).
- **Writes:** incident report, escalation request and draft transitions go through the B1 command log with
  turn-scoped IDs, so each mutation and its action record commit together. Turn results carry `branch` and
  `action_records`; a failed turn lists what was saved (error `details` and `GET .../turns/{id}`), and a retry runs
  only what is missing. Taps: `incident.edit/confirm/dismiss` with `expected_version`.
- **Checks:** `tests/test_incidents.py` (5): structured fields and one report per turn, pending escalation, asked
  description carrying the escalation, a forced crash after the incident commit (kept, not repeated on retry),
  draft isolation/confirm/dismiss/version/ownership by voice and tap, unsupported capability. Migration upgrade
  tests extended for the new columns. Full suite and both contract drift checks pass. Live Vertex classification of
  the new fields is not observed.

## B1: assigned tasks and the shared command path

- **Schema v4:** `sites`, `site_zones`, `shifts`, `task_assignments` (versioned lifecycle) and `command_log`
  (scope + command ID, fingerprint, outcome, record reference, summary, state version, saved result). The three
  shared seed tasks are untouched; legacy and unbound sessions still use them for "next task".
- **Seeding:** `scripts/seed_demo.py` loads the tracked synthetic fixture into the database and writes the trusted
  bindings file for one service date. It is idempotent and never overwrites differing rows.
- **Binding:** a bound session gets its shift and tasks. Binding is explicit (`site_id` + `shift_id` matching a
  trusted binding) or automatic on the server (exactly one trusted binding for that operator/machine for today at
  the site).
- **One command path:** voice ("start the next task", "I finished the task") and `POST .../commands` (`task.start` /
  `task.complete`). Identity is scoped per principal or per turn; an identical retry returns the saved result, a
  reused ID with a different payload is 409 `idempotency_conflict`, and a stale version or illegal step is 409
  `version_conflict` / `invalid_transition`. An operator only reaches their own shift's tasks; supervisors get 403.
- **Checks:** `tests/test_tasks.py` (7): idempotent seeding and refusal to overwrite, auto and explicit binding, the
  voice lifecycle and same-turn retry, tap rules shared with voice, isolation across all 5 assets and operators,
  unbound legacy behaviour, and a populated v3 → v4 upgrade. Existing migration, session, auth, API, resilience and
  contract tests pass (version assertions now derive from the migration list). Both contract checks were
  regenerated and are clean.

## Batch A (fast track): connect voice through the existing JSON APIs

- **Recorded:** 2026-09-24. Branch `backend`. Order per `BACKEND_FAST_TRACK_PLAN.md`: voice integration comes before I02c/I02d. The user's commit `c779e26` ("check apis") holds the Gemini-on-Vertex integration and git-ignores `Cocoon_Dataset_v1/`. Batch A adds `4d324fc` (bounded Vertex calls, one model call per turn) and the commit containing this entry (499 mapping, voice handoff, docs).
- **Runs now:**
  - The 7 JSON routes, unchanged.
  - Live mode on Gemini `gemini-3.8-flash` via Vertex (`orbit-507316`, `global`, SDK ADC; the credential file is never opened by backend code). One routing call per turn; the reply is worded from the saved action results.
  - Bounds: 1 call in flight, 8 waiting, 3 attempts with 1–4 s jittered backoff for 408/429/5xx/timeouts only, 20 s per call, 45 s per turn.
  - No mock or alternate-model fallback.
- **Checks:**
  - Focused provider tests: 18, covering retry budget and hint capping, non-retried 400/403/404, the 499 deadline message, one call in flight, queue full, template wording, and an HTTP turn where a 429 leaves nothing behind and the same `turn_id` later succeeds once with one model call.
  - Full suite run once after the provider change: 287 passed, 1 skipped (Windows symlink case). The 499 test was added afterwards and passes.
  - Both contract drift checks are clean.
- **Backend HTTP evidence (mock, real process):**
  - `smoke.py` SMOKE OK.
  - Session 201/200; unknown IDs → 422; association change → 409.
  - Turn 200; identical retry returns the stored result; changed text → 409; status GET.
  - Telemetry → announcement; events poll; delivery 200; "why" explanation; 404 and 401 envelopes.

  The exact bodies are in `docs/VOICE_INTEGRATION.md`.
- **Live evidence (real Vertex calls, sanitized):**
  - Direct SDK probes: 7 of 7 calls succeeded (4 spaced about 8 s apart, then a burst of 3); 1.6–4.2 s each; `traffic_type ON_DEMAND`.
  - A 5-turn live run through the backend: 2 turns returned 200 (≈5.7 s and ≈5.0 s; `information_requested` and `alert_explained`).
  - 2 turns hit `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` ("Resource exhausted. Please try again later.") on all 3 attempts. The payload had no quota ID and no RetryInfo.
  - 1 turn ended with `499 CANCELLED` at the 20 s per-call deadline.
  - Every failure was a retryable `503 llm_unavailable` with no record written. No token appeared in any log.
  - **Diagnosis:** time-dependent shared on-demand capacity, not a fixed per-project call count. No quota purchase or model change was made (neither is authorised).
- **Not observed:** microphone → backend → speaker audio, Android, and the voice worker's `remote_langgraph` wiring (voice owner). Streaming, cancel and per-turn delivery are still proposed only.
- **Voice owner's action:** `docs/VOICE_INTEGRATION.md` → "Voice owner's remaining work".
- **Next:** Batch B (operator workflow), not an automatic return to I02c.

## I02b: actor authentication and `/v1/me`

- **Recorded:** 2026-09-24. Branch `backend`, base `2ea49eb`. That commit merges `main` (voice PR #2, `livekit-voice/**` only) on top of I02a `ec9f02c`. Chain verified: `6bcbf88` ← `ec9f02c` ← `2ea49eb` = HEAD. Backend and contract files at `2ea49eb` are identical to `ec9f02c`.
- **Scope:** the actor-identity slice of I02. **I02 is still partial.** Consent (I02c) and the command/action ledger with recovery (I02d) are not done.
- **Commit:** `feat(auth): add scoped actor tokens and current-principal endpoint`; see `git log -1 -- langgraph-agent/docs/HANDOFF.md`.

### What changed

- **Schema version 3** (`actor_tokens`). New `principals` table (operator or supervisor, immutable; an operator principal is bound to one catalog operator and the snapshot it was verified against; at most one principal per operator). New `actor_tokens` table: SHA-256 digest only, scopes, issue/expiry; only revocation can change, once; no deletes. All v2 records, catalog snapshots and the session immutability rule are unchanged; this was tested on a populated v2 database.
- **Tokens.**
  - Format: `cct_` + `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`, i.e. 256 random bits.
  - Lifetime: 5 minutes to 30 days (default 12 h), on the wall clock. Data time and client timestamps never affect it.
  - Scopes: operator `me:read sessions:own`, supervisor `me:read`. The scopes a token presents are intersected with its role's scopes, so a token can never widen itself.
  - Expiry and revocation are checked on every request, with no cache.
- **Service credential** (`COCOON_SERVICE_TOKEN`): unchanged. It is compared in constant time before any token lookup and never stored. An unrecognised `cct_` token never falls back to service access.
- **Resolver.**
  - Exactly one `Authorization` header; a credential of at most 256 characters.
  - Every failure gets the same sanitized 401. A token-store error gets 503 `auth_unavailable` and never succeeds.
  - Route dependencies deny before the body is parsed or any tool runs.
- **CLI** `scripts/actor_tokens.py` (`issue`, `list`, `show`, `revoke`):
  - The token is written once to a new `--out` file. It refuses to overwrite, and it revokes the new token if the file cannot be written.
  - The token is never printed. `list` and `show` never show the token or its digest. Revocation is by `token_id`.
- **Access matrix (implemented):**

| Operation | Service | Operator token | Supervisor token |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/healthz`, `/readyz` | public | public | public |
| `GET /v1/me` | service principal | own principal + own verified sessions | own principal |
| `POST /v1/sessions` | unchanged | 403 | 403 |
| turns (POST, GET), state, events | unchanged | own `catalog_verified` session, else 404 | 403 |
| telemetry, event delivery | unchanged | 403 | 403 |

- **Ownership checked for operators.**
  - **Parent session:** it must be `catalog_verified` and its stored `operator_id` must equal the token's operator; otherwise the same 404 as a missing session.
  - **Children:** turn and event lookups stay inside that session.
  - **Tools:** incidents, alerts, announcements, pending questions and the conversation checkpoint are per session. The incident tool writes under the trusted session, not utterance text; request bodies with unknown fields (`operator_id`, `session_id`, `role`) are 422.
  - **Training (a fix found during I02b testing):** assignments are keyed by an operator string that legacy sessions may share. An assignment is now visible and reusable only when its owning session has the **same binding class** as the reader.
    - A verified operator never sees or receives a legacy record.
    - A legacy session no longer sees a verified operator's assignment. That is a narrowing of the service's view of legacy sessions, and it only applies when a legacy session's free-text operator equals a catalog ID.
    - A pair held by the other class is withheld (the tool answers with training status) rather than handed over.
- **Shared content, deliberately not scoped:** the seed task list (T-101..T-103) and the lesson catalogue. They have no owner and no mutation path; operator assignments come in I07A. No actor operation on the seven routes is withheld beyond the matrix above.
- **Legacy sessions:** service-only. No actor adopts them through a name match, and their association is unchanged.
- **`GET /v1/me`:** `Cache-Control: no-store`. It returns kind, subject, operator, scopes, `token_id` (non-secret) and expiry. `site_ids` is always empty. Associations are only the operator's own verified sessions; catalog membership is never listed.

### Contracts

- **Runtime `contracts/openapi.yaml` (additive):**
  - new path `GET /v1/me` and schemas `MeResponse` and `SessionAssociation`;
  - new error codes `forbidden` and `auth_unavailable`;
  - 403 (and 503 `auth_unavailable`) responses documented on the seven routes;
  - the security scheme text describes the two alternative credentials.
  - No property was removed, and required lists are unchanged.
- **Proposed contract:** `GET /v1/me` is promoted to `implemented` (stage I02b), and the proposed `MeResponse` now *is* the runtime model. All other proposed routes stay proposed and unregistered.
- **Docs:** `API_CONTRACT.md` has a new "Actor access (I02b)" section, the updated auth rule and error table, and the TLS note.

### Checks run and observed results

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `COCOON_LLM_MODE=mock python -m pytest -q` | **270 passed, 1 skipped.** The skip is the Windows symlink case, still not exercised on this machine. |
| New `tests/test_auth.py` | 22 passed. Version-2 upgrade, CLI and refusal cases, credential validation, expiry via an injected clock, live revocation, fail-closed token store, the full matrix, `/v1/me` for each principal, two-operator isolation, nested state and training-tool scoping, legacy sessions, and catalog loss after issuance. |
| Updated tests | `test_migrations.py` and `test_sessions.py` now expect schema version 3 (intentional). |
| `export_openapi.py --check` / `export_proposed_contract.py --check` | Both up to date |
| Real processes (temp DB, random service secret, port 8768, local dataset) | CLI issued two operator tokens and one supervisor token (values never printed) and refused an unknown operator. Smoke passed. Operator 1: `/me` 200 with its own sessions and `no-store`; own state 200; own turn 200; operator 2's state and turn 404; session create and telemetry 403. Supervisor: `/me` 200 with no sites or associations; state 403. Service `/me` returns the service principal. **Revoked operator 1 while running → next request 401.** |
| Orderly restart on the same DB | Revoked token still 401; operator 2, supervisor and service still 200; `list` shows 1 revoked and 2 active; 1 incident for operator 1, 0 for operator 2; schema 3. No plaintext token in the DB files; 0 secrets in server logs or CLI output. Temp data, tokens and logs deleted. |

**Not proven:** an abrupt crash, in-flight turn behaviour at revocation (a request that already passed authentication completes), long-lived stream revalidation (I08), and anything to do with site scoping, consent or client integration. The Windows ACL of token files is inherited, not restricted.

**Hard-kill observation from I02a:** still unresolved and documented in `docs/MIGRATIONS.md` → "Recovery notes". It was not reproduced during I02b, which used orderly stops only.

### Next increment

**I02c: consent records and enforcement.**
- Operator-owned, purpose-specific consent grants and revocations (`vitals_processing`, `risk_sharing_supervisor`, `camera_drowsiness`) with notice version and expected version.
- `GET`/`POST /v1/operators/{operator_id}/consents`: the operator token only for writes, and a supervisor gets 403.
- An enforcement hook that later wellbeing and risk projections must call. Missing or revoked consent means unavailable, never low risk.

The command/action ledger and recovery (I02d) stays separate. Supervisor site grants wait for DG-01 or a documented trusted site source.

## I02a: versioned storage and catalog-bound sessions

- **Recorded:** 2026-09-24. Branch `backend`, base `6bcbf88` (I01). Chain verified: `f8afb4d` ← `6bcbf88` = HEAD before this commit, and no later commits existed.
- **Scope:** the first slice of I02 only. **I02 is partly complete.** Not done here: actor tokens, `/v1/me`, consent enforcement, the command/action ledger, queue and recovery redesign.
- **Requirements advanced:** SYS-09 (versioned, atomic migrations; DB-serialised session creation) and SYS-13 (catalog-verified IDs). No form feature becomes verified.
- **Commit:** this handoff is part of `feat(storage): add versioned migrations and catalog-bound sessions`; see `git log -1 -- langgraph-agent/docs/HANDOFF.md`.

### What changed at runtime

- **Migrations.**
  - cocoon.db now has a `schema_migrations` ledger at **version 2**.
  - A pre-I02a database whose layout exactly matches the v1 baseline is *adopted* as v1 without changes, then v2 adds catalog snapshot tables and nullable session binding columns.
  - Each step and its ledger row commit together in one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction; no `executescript`.
  - Unknown layouts, newer versions, ledger gaps and locks fail clearly and change nothing. A migration error stops startup.
  - Details and the backup/restore procedure are in `docs/MIGRATIONS.md`, with the new `scripts/backup_db.py` (SQLite Online Backup API).
- **Catalog.**
  - `DATASET_ROOT` (default `../Cocoon_Dataset_v1`, resolved from `langgraph-agent/`) and `DATASET_MANIFEST_SHA256` (pinned full digest).
  - Startup verifies the manifest bytes, then `machines.csv` and `operators.csv` against the manifest digests, parses those same bytes strictly, and keeps an immutable snapshot. The snapshot is recorded append-only in `catalog_versions*`.
  - If the catalog fails, the process still runs, but `/readyz` returns 503 (`catalog: false`, `catalog_issue`), new sessions get 503 `catalog_unavailable`, and existing sessions keep working. There is no fallback to arbitrary IDs.
- **Sessions.** `POST /v1/sessions` first compares an existing `client_session_key` with its stored association (200 or 409). For a new key:
  - an unknown machine gets 422 `unknown_machine`, checked first; if both IDs are unknown, the details name both fields;
  - an unknown operator gets 422 `unknown_operator`;
  - otherwise it creates the session, storing `dataset_manifest_sha256` and `binding_status: catalog_verified`.
- **Site/shift.**
  - `site_id`/`shift_id` are optional and must be sent together. They must match a trusted server-controlled binding (`SESSION_BINDINGS_PATH`, schema `cocoon.session-bindings.v1`); otherwise the answer is 422 `validation_error`.
  - Without them, `context_status` is `unavailable` and site/shift are null. No binding file is configured by default, and the dataset has no site/shift data (DG-01).
  - A retry can never change a stored binding, and a DB trigger makes stored associations immutable.
- **Legacy sessions.** Pre-upgrade rows keep their IDs, history and saved results, with `binding_status: legacy_unverified`, `context_status: legacy_unverified` and a NULL manifest. No current hash is attached retroactively. Retrieval under the old free-text IDs still works, and turns and state still work. To move to verified IDs, create a new session with a new `client_session_key`.
- **API (runtime, additive only).**
  - `SessionCreateRequest` gains optional `site_id`/`shift_id`.
  - `Session` gains `dataset_manifest_sha256`, `binding_status`, `site_id`, `shift_id`, `context_status` and `context_source`.
  - `ReadyResponse` gains `catalog`, `catalog_version`, `catalog_issue` and `schema_version`.
  - The error codes `unknown_machine`, `unknown_operator` and `catalog_unavailable` are added.
  - Required lists are unchanged and no property was removed (checked against the previous `contracts/openapi.yaml`).

### Catalog reference (full digests)

| Record | SHA-256 | Bytes covered |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pinned manifest digest (runtime) | `5d7de31c1856daf4179110a653d175891a102a53263356843792dd383f40e42d` | `Cocoon_Dataset_v1/data/generated/manifest.json` |
| Package fingerprint (documentation) | `bdd55830094dcb413daa1ee8858f4240d8a57b225d63cc27b6288d311bd2b3d1` | `Cocoon_Dataset_v1/CHECKSUMS.sha256` |

Both were recomputed in I02a with the I01 procedure and are identical to I01; `sha256sum -c` passes for 33/33 files. **Status: provisional local development snapshot.** The dataset is still untracked, **not reviewed by the data owner**, and it does not approve any missing safety input.

Development catalog IDs used by the smoke test: machine `EXC_DEMO_001`, operator `OP_DEMO_1_1` (default), plus rejection checks with `cat-320-demo` and `smoke-operator`. The restart check used `LDR_DEMO_001` + `OP_DEMO_1_1`.

### Changed paths

| Path | Change |
| --- | --- |

| `COCOON_LLM_MODE=mock python -m pytest -q` | **248 passed, 1 skipped.** The skipped case is the symlink-escape test: this Windows account cannot create symlinks. The check is implemented but not exercised here. |
| Pre-existing test files only (api, contract, live-brain offline, mock brain, resilience, proposed contract) | **204 passed**: 203 before, plus the newly registered runtime example. Tests that used `op`/`m` now use catalog IDs; their assertions are unchanged. |
| New tests | `test_migrations.py` 11, `test_catalog.py` 19 + 1 skip, `test_sessions.py` 14 |
| `export_openapi.py --check` / `export_proposed_contract.py --check` | Both up to date after regeneration |
| Local integration | `test_local_development_dataset_matches_the_pinned_reference` passed against the untracked dataset (5 assets with the expected models, 15 operators) |
| Real processes (temporary data dir, random token, port 8767, default `DATASET_ROOT`) | `/readyz` ready, `catalog_version` = pinned digest, `schema_version` 2; `smoke.py`: `SMOKE OK`; new session 201 `catalog_verified`; unknown machine → 422 `unknown_machine`; unknown operator → 422 `unknown_operator` |
| Orderly restart (Ctrl+Break → `Application shutdown complete`, exit code 3 = Windows Ctrl+Break status) | After restart: session retry 200 with an identical association and binding (`state_version` 0 → 1 from the turn); `GET` turn result identical; turn retry identical; DB has **1** session for the key and **1** incident; ledger `[1 applied, 2 applied]`; one catalog version (5 machines, 15 operators) |
| Log hygiene | 0 occurrences of the token and 0 lines containing operator IDs in the server logs. Processes stopped; temporary data and logs deleted; port free. |

A first attempt used `terminate()` (a hard kill on Windows). Reading the DB immediately afterwards gave a transient `disk I/O error`; on re-open the database passed `PRAGMA integrity_check`. That run was discarded, and the reported result is the graceful-stop run.

**Not proven:** interrupted-turn recovery, crash in the middle of a migration beyond SQLite's atomic commit, multi-process startup, cancellation, streaming, a live model (Vertex or Anthropic), voice or client integration, and site-scoped authorisation. The voice worker's own contract tests were **not run**: its venv doesn't exist and its folder is off-limits. The changes are additive and its models ignore unknown response fields, but that check is still open.

### Handoffs and prerequisites

- **Voice owner (not contacted; note in `API_CONTRACT.md` → "Client migration note (I02a)"):** new sessions need catalog IDs (`EXC_DEMO_001` + a catalog operator, for example `OP_DEMO_1_1`). The worker's current `cat-320-demo`/identity defaults would get 422 on a new session. Existing keys keep working. Before remote integration with this backend, the worker must switch. **Status: open; nobody has confirmed reading it.**
- **Data owner:** review and version the dataset snapshot (commit it or publish a reviewed manifest hash). Until then the pin stays provisional. Site/zone/shift data (DG-01) is still missing, so real sessions report `context_status: unavailable`.
- **Operators of the backend:** back up with `scripts/backup_db.py` before upgrading a database you care about. The upgrade is automatic at startup.

### Next increment

**I02b: scoped actor authentication and `/v1/me`.**
- Server-issued opaque actor tokens (operator, supervisor), stored hashed, with expiry and revocation, plus a local provisioning CLI with no default secret.
- Principal resolution alongside the unchanged service token; `GET /v1/me`.
- Operator actors bound to their own `catalog_verified` sessions only. Supervisor tokens are refused on operator routes.

Consent (I02c) and the command/action ledger with recovery (I02d) stay separate, reviewable slices. Supervisor site scoping has to wait for DG-01 site data or a documented trusted binding source.

## I01: freeze the compatible contracts and fixtures

- **Recorded:** 2026-09-24. Branch `backend`, base `f8afb4d` (I00, verified as an ancestor of HEAD; no later commits existed).
- **Requirements covered:** contract readiness for REQ/ADD/SYS rows (see `FEATURE_MATRIX.md`, "Contract readiness after I01"). **No runtime behaviour changed and no form feature became runtime-verified.**
- **Commit:** this handoff is part of the I01 commit (`feat(contract): define compatible agent and application interfaces`). Use `git log --oneline -1 -- langgraph-agent/docs/HANDOFF.md`.

### Current versus proposed artifacts

| Artifact | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `contracts/openapi.yaml` | **Runtime contract (unchanged).** What the app serves today: 7 `/v1` routes plus health. |
| `contracts/proposed/openapi.json` | **Proposed target contract, not served.** 9 implemented operations copied unchanged, plus 18 proposed operations with `x-implementation-status`, `x-target-stage`, `x-callers`, `x-idempotency` and `x-target-changes`. |
| `contracts/proposed/schemas/` | Standalone JSON Schemas: `cocoon.turn-stream.v1`, `cocoon.announcements.v1`, `cocoon.supervisor-feed.v1`, `cocoon.command.v1` |
| `contracts/proposed/internal/` | Backend-internal classifier decision and action plan schemas |
| `contracts/proposed/examples/` (100), `sequences/` (12), `exchanges/` (6), `sse/` (1) | Synthetic contract fixtures with expected outcomes |
| `langgraph-agent/cocoon_agent/contract/` | Source models; never imported by the app (checked by a test in a fresh subprocess) |

### Changed paths

| Path | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `langgraph-agent/cocoon_agent/contract/*.py` (17 files) | New proposed-contract models, route registry/builder and pure sequence checks |
| `langgraph-agent/scripts/export_proposed_contract.py` | New generator with `--check` |
| `langgraph-agent/tests/test_proposed_contract.py` | New contract checks (146 cases) |
| `contracts/proposed/**` | Generated spec/schemas plus reviewed fixtures and README |
| `API_CONTRACT.md` | Artifact roles, drift commands, endpoint capability table (27 operations), compatibility decisions, streaming/announcement/privacy rules, state-transition tables |
| `BACKEND_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` | One sentence in section 6: the "twelve routes" are 7 implemented + 5 proposed |
| `README.md` (root) | Narrow edit: phase wording no longer says branch `voice`; notes that backend streaming is proposed, not implemented |
| `langgraph-agent/README.md`, `langgraph-agent/CLAUDE.md`, `docs/FEATURE_MATRIX.md`, `docs/DATA_GAPS.md`, `docs/HANDOFF.md` | Documentation and status updates |

Unchanged: `cocoon_agent/api/**`, `graph/**`, `service.py`, `store.py`, `rules.py`, `config.py`, `contracts/openapi.yaml`, `contracts/examples/**`, dependencies and lock files, `livekit-voice/**`, `Cocoon_Dataset_v1/`. No dependency was added: `jsonschema` and `pyyaml` were already dev dependencies.

### Checks run and observed results

Environment: the I00 `.venv`, Python 3.11.15, explicit `COCOON_LLM_MODE=mock`, no credentials, no network calls.

| Command (from `langgraph-agent/`) | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `COCOON_LLM_MODE=mock python -m pytest -q` | **203 passed** (57 existing + 146 new) |
| `python -m pytest -q` on the five pre-existing test files | **57 passed**, the same as the I00 baseline |
| `python scripts/export_openapi.py --check` | `contract up to date` (runtime export unchanged) |
| `python scripts/export_proposed_contract.py --check` | `proposed contract up to date` |
| Mock server on port 8766, temp data dir, throwaway token + `scripts/smoke.py` | `/readyz` ready; `SMOKE OK (llm_mode=mock)` |
| Probes on the same server | unknown machine → **201** (documented gap, unchanged); `POST .../turns/stream` → 405; `GET /v1/me` → 404 |
| Token grep in server log | 0 matches; process stopped, temp data and log deleted |
| Dataset `sha256sum -c CHECKSUMS.sha256` (read-only) | 33/33 OK; fingerprint recorded in `DATA_GAPS.md` |

What the 146 contract checks cover:
- the generated spec equals the committed files;
- implemented operations are copied byte-for-byte from the runtime spec;
- no proposed route is registered in the app, and the runtime spec has no target-only schemas;
- all `$ref`s resolve, and component and standalone schemas pass the JSON Schema meta-schema;
- each of the 100 fixtures behaves as labelled (valid → accepted by Pydantic and JSON Schema; invalid → rejected by the stated layer);
- every v1 example is still valid under its target model;
- sequence invariants hold (fixed identity, increasing sequence, one terminal event, deltas equal to saved speech, unique announcement IDs);
- exchange statuses are documented and their bodies validate;
- the chunked SSE fixture is self-consistent against a test-only reference reader;
- supervisor projections are closed and have no private field names;
- the API_CONTRACT table lists every route with the right status.

**Not run and not claimed:** any proposed route (none exists), live Vertex or Anthropic calls, the voice worker, Android or supervisor clients, streaming over a socket, cancellation, restart recovery, database uniqueness for new records, and dataset generation. The contract checks do not prove runtime behaviour.

### I00 findings: resolved at contract level versus still open

| I00 finding | After I01 |
| --- | --- |
| Unknown machine accepted (201) | Contract decided: 422 `unknown_machine` / `unknown_operator` (intentional, documented tightening). **Runtime unchanged**; enforced in I02 with the catalog. |
| No streaming route, no `/v1/me` | Specified as `proposed` (I08, I02). **Not implemented.** The 405 comes from the registered `GET .../turns/{turn_id}` template matching `turn_id=stream`. |
| "Twelve routes" wording | Plan and API_CONTRACT now say 7 implemented + 5 proposed. |
| Anthropic implementation vs Vertex design | Decision recorded: Vertex selected; replacement and model/access verification in I04. No provider code or dependency changed. |
| Missing data/content (DG-01..DG-16) | Shapes defined in the contract. **Data, content, published guidance and WESAD still missing.** |
| Untracked dataset | Local snapshot fingerprint recorded. Data-owner review and versioning is still a prerequisite for I03. |
| Root README said branch `voice` | Fixed with a narrow edit. |
| No client integration | Unchanged. Voice, Android and supervisor integration remain later, separately assigned work. |

### Migration note for other owners

- **Voice and simulator:** `POST /v1/sessions` will reject free-text machine IDs such as `cat-320-demo` once I02 lands. Switch to a catalog asset ID (`EXC_DEMO_001` etc.) before then. Every other change to the seven routes is additive and optional.
- **Android and supervisor:** build against `contracts/proposed/openapi.json` and the standalone schemas. Use scoped actor tokens (I02), never the service token. Supervisor views come only from `/v1/supervisor/*`.
- **Data:** the fixture shapes in `contracts/proposed/examples/valid/telemetry_v2_batch.request.json`, `conditions_forecast.json` and `task_assignment.json` are the target for the I03A extension. Their values are not data.

### Next increment: first I02 slice

**I02a: catalog-bound sessions on a versioned schema.**
1. Add versioned SQLite migrations (schema version table) that upgrade the current v1 tables in place.
2. Add a `DATASET_ROOT` setting (default `../Cocoon_Dataset_v1`). Load a read-only machine/operator catalog keyed by manifest hash.
3. Enforce 422 `unknown_machine` / `unknown_operator` on `POST /v1/sessions`, and store `site_id`/`shift_id`/manifest hash on the session as the target contract specifies.
4. Update the backend tests, smoke script and simulator to use catalog IDs, and regenerate both contracts.

Actor tokens, `/v1/me`, consent and the command/action ledger follow as separate I02 slices.

Prerequisites:
- the data owner confirms or commits the dataset snapshot (the manifest hash above), or explicitly accepts the local fingerprint for development;
- the voice owner is told about the catalog-ID switch (no voice change is made by the backend);
- the I02 handoff records the unknown-ID behaviour change.

## I00: inspect the checkout and close the scope audit

- **Recorded:** 2026-09-24. Branch `backend`, base commit `ee83254` (merge of PR #1, the voice branch, on top of `521d318`).
- **Plan:** `BACKEND_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` revision 2.1, committed with this increment.
- **Requirements covered:** audit of every REQ/ADD/SYS row; SYS-14 and SYS-15 progress. No runtime behaviour changed.
- **Commit:** this handoff is part of the I00 commit (`docs(backend): reconcile review form and implementation baseline`). The hash cannot be written into its own commit. Use `git log --oneline -1 -- langgraph-agent/docs/HANDOFF.md`.

### Changed paths

| Path | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `BACKEND_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` | Added to Git; it was untracked. Content unchanged from the reviewed revision 2.1. |
| `langgraph-agent/docs/FEATURE_MATRIX.md` | New. Every REQ/ADD/SYS row with tier, owner, data prerequisite, stage, status and I00 evidence, plus a plan-versus-checkout mismatch table. |
| `langgraph-agent/docs/DATA_GAPS.md` | New. Verified v1 dataset state, supplied fields, 16 missing-data entries (DG-01..DG-16) and source limits. |
| `langgraph-agent/docs/HANDOFF.md` | New. This file. |
| `langgraph-agent/CLAUDE.md` | Snapshot, verified commands, active work and latest handoff updated from I00 evidence. Pointer to the plan added. |

No code, schema, contract, fixture, dependency or config file changed. `contracts/openapi.yaml` is unchanged and its drift check still passes.

### Environment used for checks

- Python 3.11.15 (uv-managed interpreter). Created a gitignored `langgraph-agent/.venv` with `uv venv --python 3.11 .venv`, `uv pip sync requirements-dev.txt` and `uv pip install -e . --no-deps`.
- Installed versions: fastapi 0.141.1, uvicorn 0.53.0, langgraph 1.2.12, langgraph-checkpoint 4.2.0, langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite 3.1.1 (`AsyncSqliteSaver`), aiosqlite 0.22.1, langchain-core 1.6.4, anthropic 1.8.0, pydantic 2.13.5, pydantic-settings 2.15.0, httpx 0.28.1.
- LLM mode: **mock only**. No live provider was called. No `.env` file was created: the smoke server took its settings from process environment variables, with a throwaway token and a data directory outside the repository.
- No credential file was read. ADC and Vertex access were not exercised.

### Checks run and observed results

| Command (working directory) | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `.venv/Scripts/python -m pytest -q` (`langgraph-agent/`) | **57 passed** in 7.1 s. No network, no credentials. |
| `.venv/Scripts/python scripts/export_openapi.py --check` (`langgraph-agent/`) | `contract up to date`, exit 0. |
| `python -m cocoon_agent` with `COCOON_LLM_MODE=mock`, port 8765, temp data dir | `/healthz` → `{"status":"ok"}`. `/readyz` → ready, database and checkpointer true, `llm_mode: mock`. |
| `.venv/Scripts/python scripts/smoke.py --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8765` | `SMOKE OK (llm_mode=mock)`. Covered: next task (T-101), incident with follow-up (stored as incident 1), lesson assignment, simulated seatbelt announcement, and "Why did you warn me?" explained from the stored alert. |
| HTTP probes on the same server | Unknown `machine_id`/`operator_id` session create → **201** (accepted; gap DG-16). No token → 401. `POST /v1/sessions/x/turns/stream` → 405 (route absent). `GET /v1/me` → 404 (route absent). |
| Server log grep for the token value | 0 matches. |
| `sha256sum -c CHECKSUMS.sha256` (`Cocoon_Dataset_v1/`) | 33/33 OK, before and after the dataset tests. |
| `python cocoon_data.py validate` (`Cocoon_Dataset_v1/`) | `status: passed`. |
| `python -m unittest test_data` (`Cocoon_Dataset_v1/`) | 12 tests OK. |
| Benchmark recomputation from `data/raw/problem_statement_task_samples.csv` | MAE 7.6 min (errors 2, 7, 12, 2, 15). |

**Not run:** live Anthropic or Vertex calls, any voice worker check, any Android or supervisor client, streaming (not implemented), and restart of a real server process. Restart survival is covered only by the in-process pytest cases `test_records_and_context_survive_restart` and `test_orphaned_processing_turn_is_rerun_after_restart`.

### Verified existing behaviour (v1 prototype, mock mode)

- Seven `/v1` JSON routes match `contracts/openapi.yaml`. Bearer service token, `X-Request-ID` echo and the error envelope are in place.
- Idempotency is enforced in SQLite: session create by `client_session_key` (200/201/409); turns by `(session_id, turn_id)` (200 replay, 202 in flight, 409 conflict); telemetry by `(session_id, event_id)`; incidents by source turn; training by `(operator_id, lesson_id)`; one active alert episode per rule.
- One prototype seatbelt rule on `simulated: true` telemetry creates one announcement per episode, clears and retriggers, and marks stale samples.
- Events are retained and cursor-paged without being consumed. Delivery reports are kept per consumer.
- "Why?" explains the latest stored alert for the session.

See `FEATURE_MATRIX.md` for how little of the filled form this covers. No form requirement is `verified`.

### Path ownership and working tree after I00

| Path | Owner | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `langgraph-agent/**`, `BACKEND_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` | Backend | I00 files committed. `.venv/`, `.pytest_cache/` and `cocoon_agent.egg-info/` are local and gitignored. |
| `API_CONTRACT.md`, `contracts/**` | Backend + voice (joint) | Unchanged. |
| `livekit-voice/**` | Voice | Unchanged, not read beyond its README/CLAUDE.md scope notes. Worker remains standalone. |
| `Cocoon_Dataset_v1/` | Data stream | **Untracked, left unstaged.** Validated read-only. The data owner decides whether to commit it. |
| Root `README.md`, `.gitignore` | Shared | Unchanged. The README still calls the current phase "branch `voice`". |

Git identity: repository-local `user.name`/`user.email` set to `Naif Naqeeb <naifnaqeeb.123@gmail.com>`, the values already configured globally for Naif. Global config was not changed. `GIT_AUTHOR_*`/`GIT_COMMITTER_*` overrides were not set in the environment.

### Blockers and prerequisites

1. **LLM provider mismatch.** The plan specifies Vertex AI via ADC. The code uses the Anthropic SDK with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Decide before I04. Do not silently swap.
2. **Dataset not in Git** on `backend`. Its integrity is verified locally, but there is no reviewed reference hash (DATA_GAPS.md). The data owner should commit it or confirm the manifest hash.
3. **Missing core inputs** (DG-01..DG-11, DG-15, DG-16): sites/zones, scheduled tasks, proximity, high-rate motion/tilt, human impact, numeric weather/forecasts, sleep, consent, rule policies, LMS content with a real video, and WESAD.
4. **No client integration** exists. The voice worker is standalone and there is no Android or supervisor client in this repository. Checkpoints 1 and 2 are unproven beyond mock HTTP.
5. **Published guidance** for thresholds (seatbelt, proximity, slope, wind/visibility, heat) is not yet sourced. Rules stay labelled demo assumptions until it is.

### Next increment

**I01: freeze the compatible contracts and fixtures.** Keep the seven existing routes compatible. Specify the five streaming/control routes and the additive operator/supervisor/command/consent/content/presentation contracts as *proposed*. Add strict schemas and fixtures for every new form field, and record the Vertex-versus-Anthropic decision as an input to I04.
